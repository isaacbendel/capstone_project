Recognize handwritten digits (Kaggle dataset). Project for Ryerson University Data Analytics program

Given a few thousand labeled images of handwritten digits - the goal is to develop a method of classfying new images of digits.

I tested several algorithms - k-means, k-nearest neigbour, binary tree, hierarchical clustering as well as various hybrid apporcahes.

This repository contains the R code, as well as some HTML docuemnts which are a mix of code, commentary, and results.
